### Motivation

Mental health is an important part of overall health and well-being. Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Mental health problems exist frequently throughout the United States. About one in five adults suffer from a diagnosable mental illness in a given year. Many common mental illnesses, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, may increase risk of suicide.


**So...**

* What is the general status of mental illness across states in the US?
* What is the overall trend of the percentage, frequency and level of anxiety and depression in the US across years?
* How do trends in anxiety and depression percentages differ by biological sex, household income, marital status, and age?
* What is the overall suicide trend across years? How does suicide differ by state, age, sex and means?
* What is the association between taking depression or anxious medication and COVID-19 exposure?
